Welcome to my repair-notes application. The idea behind this application is that an auto repair company is using this applicaiton to become more organized and improve communication amongst employees. Please see the available features below:


1. Public facing page with basic contact info 
2. Employee login to the notes app 
3. Welcome page after login 
4. Easy navigation
5. Current user and assigned role are displaed in the footer
6. Logout option 
7. Security setting enabled which require users to login at least once per week
8. Management and Admin have been provided a way to remove employee access asap if needed 
9. Notes are assigned to specific employees 
10. Notes have a ticket #, title, note body, created & updated dates
11. Notes are either OPEN or COMPLETED 
12. Users can be Employees, Managers, or Admins 
13. Notes can only be deleted by Managers or Admins 
14. Employees can only view and edit their assigned notes  
15.  Managers and Admins can view, edit, and delete all notes 
16. Only Managers and Admins can access User Settings 
17. Only Managers and Admins can create new users 

Test out each role and see the differences between employee and management access:
Management: 
  * Username: Beth
  * Password: !Hh12345
Employee:
  * Username: HankD
  * password: !Hh12345

front end start command is npm start
back end start command is npm run dev

This application is best viewed on a computer or tablet. Complete mobile optimaztion is coming soon!
